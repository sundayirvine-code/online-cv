Additionally, I provided cost estimates to customers for the purchase of devices. To guarantee that the devices were in good working order, I performed proof tests such as phone and SIM card testing and power tests. I acquired expertise and knowledge in Safaricom services such as M-pesa and Jitambulishe to ensure the consistent delivery of outstanding services. I kept myself up-to-date on the latest telecommunication developments by attending training.
